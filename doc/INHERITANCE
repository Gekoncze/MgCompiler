IS
    base-type <- derived-type (one way commutable)
    can add new properties
    can add new static functions
    can add new dynamic functions

ALIAS
    base-type <-> derived-type (two way commutable)
    can add new static functions

VIEW
    base-type -> derived-type (one way commutable)
    can add new static functions

LIKE
    base-type - derived-type (no way commutable)
    can add new properties
    can add new static functions
    can add new dynamic functions

can be used in datatype definitions
cannot inherit from different datatype kind (for example class cannot inherit from structure)

note: language entity names are also static variables of corresponding types in cz.mg.language as an alias
      and so they can be used in code as variables or parameters to operators above
