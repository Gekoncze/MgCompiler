much later
    modules

    compiler
        add healing spots
            not only separating compilation of each line
            but also a part until which line is correct and after which is errorneous
                process line only up until the point where is correct
                automatically close all brackets and other groups
            do not add more errors if (probably current task?) already has some
                because the new ones are most probably caused by the previous ones

later
    maybe just one error per file ??? or per definition ???
    translator to c/cpp
    custom stamps definitions

    project
        add option to specify target mg language version

    automatické volání konstruktorů destruktorů ???
        kdy a jak?
        mohl by být třeba na to command ... declaration command

    an idea - class could be location at the same time
        this could allow to place "inner" classes and functions in separate files
        on filesystem level, it could be solved as a folder with the same name as the class (note: no extension)


soon
    resolver
        first has to resolve stamps, then other
        aliases has to be stored somehow, or searched by context

        maybe separate step in resolver to fill in context entities ???
            that would require re-creating context for each entity ...
            better would be remporary context object that would be filled with all possible entity links
            but links can be created not only with name ... operators too, and depends on input parameters too

    test
        types.mg - define all required operators in test file

    language
            templates !!! or collections ... !
            exceptions - type for buildin, SAVEPOINT/TRY, CATCH, ROLLBACK, ...

            compilation
                build stamp definitions

            aggregation as clever pointers
                option to track normal pointers too in debug mode

now
    cli
        add different versions of tree command
            possibly for each kind of entities / tasks
            add command to clear output
            pwd - print square brackets
            scroll down after issuing command
